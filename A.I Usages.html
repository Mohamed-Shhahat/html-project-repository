      <center><h2>Cybersecurity</h2></center>
<p>AI systems can help recognise and fight cyberattacks and other cyber threats based on the continuous input of data,
   recognising patterns and backtracking the attacks.</p>
   <center><h2>Fighting disinformation</h2></center>
   <p>Certain AI applications can detect fake news and disinformation by mining social media information, looking for words
      that are sensational or alarming and identifying which online sources are deemed authoritative.</p>
      <center><h2>Cars</h2></center>
      <p>While self-driving vehicles are not yet standard, cars already use AI-powered safety functions.
         The EU has for example helped to fund VI-DAS, automated sensors that detect possible dangerous situations and accidents.
      </p>
      <center><h2>Artificial intelligence against Covid-19</h2></center>
      <P>In the case of Covid-19, AI has been used in thermal imaging in airports and elsewhere.
         In medicine it can help recognise infection from computerised tomography lung scans.
          It has also been used to provide data to track the spread of the disease.</P>
